                    <h3>Arduino Bluetooth Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have experience working with the Arduino microcontroller. My favorite project pertaining to this is an app that allowed me to remotely turn on and off christmas lights. To do this I wired a relay and bluetooth controller to an Arduino and created a basic android app to communicate with the setup.<br><br> I overcame many challenges and learned throughout this process, especially in regard to getting the bluetooth controller and my app to properly communicate. I did this by referencing both bluetooth projects created by other makers, and reading the specification sheets for the controller. Armed with more information I was able to configure the ports properly and solve the largest Christmas crisis of our century, having to get up to turn on and off Christmas lights each day. <br><br>

                    <h3>4 Bit Decade Counter</h3>
                    <p>

                        <br><br>
                        Shown below is a full 4 bit decade counter constructed on a breadboard next to the circuit diagram describing it. Designed and implemented using digital logic, the circuit starts with a 5v input signal into a 555 timer (Left) and a series of capacitors to charge and discharge at a rate of 1 tick per second (1Hz). We then send this signal into the 4 bit ripple counter.
                        
                        <br><br> In short, a ripple counter carries a signal through a series of latches. Each latch can hold either a binary 0 or 1 and can seen in the top left of the circuit diagram. In effect, the 4 bits of the ripple counter transition from 0000->0001->0010->0011... and so on "rippling" the signal serially down the line. In decimal this count sequence is represented as 0->1->2->3.... This continues on up until a binary 1111 or until decimal number 15, giving us a count from 0 to 15 incrementing once per second from the clock. 
                        
                        <br><br> This is pretty neat, but if we want a decade counter from 0->9 we need some way of resetting the count. Fortunately, each of our 4 latches comes with a reset pin that sets it's value back to 0. Essentially, we check if the value is a binary "10", and if it is, we have completed the cycle for 0->9 and trigger all the reset pins to restart the sequence back to "0000". This is done by the NAND chip in the upper middle section of the diagram. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        The next block of the circuit is the multiplexor or MUX sitting right in the middle of the diagram taking inputs from the ripple counter and the digital logic at the bottom of the diagram. The digital logic takes the value of the circuit and inverts it, so instead of counting from 0->9 we count down from 9->0. 
                        
                        For as cool a name as multiplexor, it's function is pretty simple. Given 2 sets of inputs it selects one or the other. In this case, the function of the MUX is to select between our count up sequence 0->9 or our count down sequence 9->0. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Finally, our count sequence is brought to the last component, the binary to 7 Segment display decoder. A 7 segment display is basically 7 led's in a figure 8, this particular IC takes in a binary count and converts the outputs into the correct orientation to turn on the led's corresponding to the count value. Thus concluding our journey from a 5v connection, all the way to a board that counts almost as good as a kindergartener. I think it's cool.

                    <h3>P5.js Space Invaders</h3>
                    <p>
                        P5.js is an open source platform for interactive, graphical experiences. Essentially, it is a library that allows you to draw shapes to a window and easily process user input. I have used this library to code a version of Space Invaders!
                        <br><br>
                        For this project I took an object oriented approach. This involved setting up classes for the aliens and ships. I took a bottom-up approach, coding each of the base classes, then adding features and game logic. Aptly titled Not Space Invaders, the final product came out as follows.

                        
                        <br><br> 
                    </p>
                    <p class="shooter"><br>
                    Use the Arrow Keys to move left and right, spacebar to shoot. <br> Shoot all the ships to win! If you get overwhelmed by alien circles you will lose.
